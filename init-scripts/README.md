# Init Scripts Directory

This directory is used for database initialization scripts that are automatically mounted to `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d` in the MariaDB container.

## Important Notes

- **Generated SQL files are NOT tracked by git** (see .gitignore)
- SQL files in this directory are automatically executed when the MariaDB container starts for the first time
- Files are executed in alphabetical order

## Common Files

- `01-extracted-schema.sql` - Generated by `make ddl` command, contains database schemas extracted from production
- `01-production-data.sql` - Generated by `make dump` command, contains full database dumps

## Usage

1. Extract DDL from production:
   ```bash
   make ddl
   ```
   This creates `01-extracted-schema.sql`

2. Start local database with extracted schema:
   ```bash
   make setup-from-ddl
   ```

3. Or extract full data:
   ```bash
   make dump
   ```

The MariaDB container will automatically execute any `.sql` files in this directory during initialization.
