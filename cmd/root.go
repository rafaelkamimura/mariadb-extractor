	Long: `MariaDB Extractor is a CLI tool for extracting database and table information
from MariaDB servers. It generates both human-readable markdown files and
machine-readable JSON files with comprehensive database schema information.

The tool connects to your MariaDB server and extracts:
- Database names and metadata
- Table names, types, and properties
- Row counts and storage information
- Engine types and collations

Outputs are saved as .md and .json files for documentation and automation purposes.`,

	// has an action associated with it:
	// Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) { },
}

// Execute adds all child commands to the root command and sets flags appropriately.
// This is called by main.main(). It only needs to happen once to the rootCmd.

	// will be global for your application.

	// Cobra also supports local flags, which will only run
